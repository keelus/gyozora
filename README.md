<h2>About gyozora</h2>
Gyozora is a fast and lightweight file explorer in early development. It currently supports Windows, but will be available for macOS & Linux systems in the future. <br /><br />
There are lots of important functionalities that haven't been developed yet. <br /><br />

<h3>To try it</h3>

Just clone the repo, and rename `appcache/appcache_empty.db` to `appcache/appcache.db`. <br />

Then, execute the following command in the root folder:
```bash
wails dev
```
